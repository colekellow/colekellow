### Hi there 👋

## Introduction 

I am a geospatial remote sensing GIS analyst that worked in the sensing and IoT world of agriculture. This is my GitHub profile where hopefully I can showcase my current and completed projects. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better code in Python for geospatial usecases among lots of other things. I will be learning how to perform database spatial queries using SQL and PostGIS/PostgreSQL

Please view my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colekellow/) account for my full background.
